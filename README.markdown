# A Breathing Lamp Driver In Verilog
## Abstract
This is a Breathing Lamp Driver verilog module.

This module is designed to achieve hardware-independence. The 'hardware-independence' means you can use this code in any FPGA, and it is paremeterized to adapt different clock inputs.

You can simpliy connect the output to a FPGA port that drives a LED.
